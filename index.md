# What Voltaire Meant by ‘One Must Cultivate One’s Own Garden

### [Abridged from the School of Life](https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/cultivate-own-garden-voltaire/)

What did Voltaire mean with his gardening advice? That we must keep a good distance<br> 
between ourselves and the world, because taking too close an interest in politics or <br>
public opinion is a fast route to aggravation and danger. We should know well enough <br>
at this point that humans are troublesome and will never achieve – at a state level – <br>
anything like the degree of logic and goodness we would wish for. We should never tie <br>
our personal moods to the condition of a whole nation or people in general; or we would <br>
need to weep continuously. We need to live in our own small plots, not the heads of <br>
strangers. At the same time, because our minds are haunted and prey to anxiety and <br>
despair, we need to keep ourselves busy. We need a project. It shouldn’t be too large <br>
or dependent on many. The project should send us to sleep every night weary but <br>
satisfied. It could be bringing up a child, writing a book, looking after a house, <br>
running a small shop or managing a little business. Or, of course, tending to a few <br>
acres. Note Voltaire’s geographical modesty. We should give up on trying to cultivate <br>
the whole of humanity, we should give up on things at a national or international <br>
scale. Take just a few acres and make those your focus. Take a small orchard and <br>
grow lemons and apricots. Take some beds and grow asparagus and carrots. Stop <br>
worrying yourself with humanity if you ever want peace of mind again. Live quietly, <br>
enjoying the sunshine in the orange bower next to your house. This is Voltaire’s 
stirring, ever relevant form of horticultural quietism.<br>
<br>
We have been warned – and guided.<br>

We melancholics know that humans – ourselves foremost among them – are beyond <br>
redemption. We melancholics have given up on dreams of complete purity and <br>
unblemished happiness. We know that this world is, for the most part, hellish <br>
and heartbreakingly vicious. We know that our minds are full of demons that <br>
will not leave us alone for long. Nevertheless, we are committed to not <br>
slipping into despondency. We remain deeply interested in kindness, <br>
in friendship, in art, in family life – and in spending some very quiet local <br>
afternoons gardening. The melancholic position is ultimately the only sensible <br>
one for a broken human. It’s where one gets to, after one has been hopeful, <br>
after one has tried love, after one has been tempted by fame, after one has <br>
despaired, after one’s gone mad, after one’s considered ending it – and after <br>
one’s decided conclusively to keep going. It captures the best possible <br>
attitude to pain – and the wisest orientation of a weary mind towards what <br>
remains hopeful and good.<br>
